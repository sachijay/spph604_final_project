	abstract = {Asthma patients may have an increased risk for diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, risk factors accelerating time-to-COPD diagnosis are unclear. This study aims to estimate risk factors associated with the incidence of COPD diagnosis in asthma patients. Canada’s Population Data BC (PopData BC) was used to identify asthma patients without prior COPD diagnosis between January 1, 1998, to December 31, 1999. Patients were assessed for time-to-incidence of COPD diagnosis from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2018. The study estimated the effects of several risk factors in predicting the incidence of COPD in asthma patients during the 18-year follow-up period. Patient factors such as Medication Adherence (MA) were assessed by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and the medication possession ratio (MPR). The log-logistic mixed-effects accelerated failure time model was used to estimate the adjusted failure time ratios (aFTR) and 95\% Confidence Interval (95\% CI) for factors predicting time-to-COPD diagnosis among asthma patients. We identified 68,211 asthma patients with a mean age of 48.2 years included in the analysis. Risk factors accelerating time-to-COPD diagnosis included: male sex (aFTR: 0.62, 95\% CI:0.56–0.68), older adults (age {\textgreater} 40 years) [aFTR: 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.02–0.04], history of tobacco smoking (aFTR: 0.29, 95\% CI: 0.13–0.68), asthma exacerbations (aFTR: 0.81, 95\%CI: 0.70, 0.94), frequent emergency admissions (aFTR:0.21, 95\% CI: 0.17–0.25), longer hospital stay (aFTR:0.07, 95\% CI: 0.06–0.09), patients with increased burden of comorbidities (aFTR:0.28, 95\% CI: 0.22–0.34), obese male sex (aFTR:0.38, 95\% CI: 0.15–0.99), SABA overuse (aFTR: 0.61, 95\% CI: 0.44–0.84), moderate (aFTR:0.23, 95\% CI: 0.21–0.26), and severe asthma (aFTR:0.10, 95\% CI: 0.08–0.12). After adjustment, MA ≥0.80 was significantly associated with 83\% delayed time-to-COPD diagnosis [i.e. aFTR =1.83, 95\%CI: 1.54–2.17 for PDC]. However, asthma severity significantly modifies the effect of MA independent of tobacco smoking history. The targeted intervention aimed to mitigate early diagnosis of COPD may prioritize enhancing medication adherence among asthma patients to prevent frequent exacerbation during follow-up.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study evaluates the burden of concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) + asthma, two highly prevalent and costly conditions. Patients and methods: The authors identified commercial enrollees from a large health plan database who were aged ≥40 years with medical and pharmacy benefits and medical claims with diagnosis codes for COPD or asthma between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. We assigned patients to COPD or COPD + asthma cohorts, excluding all others. A patient index date was the first evidence date of COPD or COPD + asthma. We excluded those with one outpatient COPD or asthma claim or who were not continuously enrolled during the 12 months before and after index date. After controlling for differences, postindex respiratory-related emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospitalizations and costs were compared between cohorts. Results: We identified 24,935 patients, 17,394 (70\%) in the COPD cohort and 7,541 (30\%) in the COPD + asthma cohort. COPD + asthma patients were younger (58 versus 60 years; p {\textless} 0.0001) and more were females (62\% vs 45\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). COPD + asthma patients were 1.6 times more likely to have respiratory-related EDs and/or hospitalizations than COPD patients (95\% CI 1.5, 1.8), and had {\textbackslash}1987 (SE = {\textbackslash}174, p {\textless} 0.0001) more respiratory-related healthcare costs. Mean adjusted respiratory-related healthcare costs were {\textbackslash}3803 for COPD and {\textbackslash}5790 for COPD + asthma. Limitations include a potential for misclassification due to misdiagnosis or coding errors as well as traditional biases of observational studies including the potential for omitted variable bias. Conclusion: COPD + asthma patients are more costly and use more services than those with COPD, and may be more unstable and require more intensive treatment.},

	abstract = {Background The purpose of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is to produce national estimates representative of the total noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population. The sample for NHANES is selected using a complex, four-stage sample design. NHANES sample weights are used by analysts to produce estimates of the health-related statistics that would have been obtained if the entire sampling frame (i.e., the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population) had been surveyed. Sampling errors should be calculated for all survey estimates to aid in determining their statistical reliability. For complex sample surveys, exact mathematical formulas for variance estimates that fully incorporate the sample design are usually not available. Variance approximation procedures are required to provide reasonable, approximately unbiased, and design-consistent estimates of variance. Objective This report describes the NHANES 2015-2018 sample design and the methods used to create sample weights and variance units for the public-use data files, including sample weights for selected subsamples, such as the fasting subsample. The impacts of sample design changes on estimation for NHANES 2015-2018 are described. Approaches that data users can use to modify sample weights when combining survey cycles or when combining subsamples are also included.},

	abstract = {Missing data commonly occur in large epidemiologic studies. Ignoring incompleteness or handling the data inappropriately may bias study results, reduce power and efficiency, and alter important risk/benefit relationships. Standard ways of dealing with missing values, such as complete case analysis (CCA), are generally inappropriate due to the loss of precision and risk of bias. Multiple imputation by fully conditional specification (FCS MI) is a powerful and statistically valid method for creating imputations in large data sets which include both categorical and continuous variables. It specifies the multivariate imputation model on a variable-by-variable basis and offers a principled yet flexible method of addressing missing data, which is particularly useful for large data sets with complex data structures. However, FCS MI is still rarely used in epidemiology, and few practical resources exist to guide researchers in the implementation of this technique. We demonstrate the application of FCS MI in support of a large epidemiologic study evaluating national blood utilization patterns in a sub-Saharan African country. A number of practical tips and guidelines for implementing FCS MI based on this experience are described.},
